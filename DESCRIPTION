Description:
  SHAR is a R package for analyzing species habitat associations. Therefore, information 
  about the location of the species is needed and about the environmental conditions. 
  To test for significance habitat associations, one of the two components is randomized.
  Methods are described in Plotkin et al. (2000), Harms et al. (2001) and Wiegand & Moloney (2014). 
  SHAR is mainly based on the 'spatstat' (Baddeley et al. 2015) and 'raster' (Hijmans 2017) package.
