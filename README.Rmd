# shar

**S**pecies-**H**abitat **A**ssociations in **R** is a `R` package to analyze species-habitat associations. Therefore, information about the location of the species is needed (as a point pattern) and about the environmental conditions (as a raster map). In order to analyse the data for significant habitat associations either the location data or the environmental data is randomized n-times. Then, counts within the habitats are compared between the randomized data and the observed data. Positive or negative associations are present if the observed counts is higher or lower than the randomized counts (using quantile thresholds). Methods are mainly described in Plotkin et al. (2000), Harms et al. (2001) and Wiegand & Moloney (2014). **shar** is mainly based on the [`spatstat`](http://spatstat.org) (Baddeley et al. 2015) and [`raster`](https://rspatial.org/raster/) (Hijmans 2017) package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **shar** from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shar/index.html) with:

```{r install-CRAN, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("shar")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar) with:

```{r install-github, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-spatialecology/shar")
```

This also automatically installs all non-base `R` package dependencies, namely the following packages: `classInt`, `raster`, `spatstat.core`, `spatstat.geom`.

## How to use shar

```{r import-libs, message = FALSE}
library(shar)
library(raster)

set.seed(42)
```

**shar** comes with build-in example data sets. `species_a` and `species_b` are exemplary location of species, e.g. trees, as `ppp`-objects from the `spatstat` package. `landscape` contains exemplary continuous environmental data. However, all methods depend on discrete data. Therefore we need to classify the data first. 
However, all methods require "fully mapped data" in a sense that NA cells of the environmental data are allowed only if simultaneously these areas cannot accommodate any locations of the point pattern (e.g., a water body within a forest area). This needs to be reflected in the observation window of the point pattern. For the torus translation method, no NA values are allowed at all.

```{r environmental-data}
landscape_classified <- classify_habitats(raster = landscape, classes = 5)
```

There are two possibilities to randomize the environmental data, both described in Harms et al. (2001). The first shifts the habitat map in all 4 cardinal directions around a torus. The second one assigns the habitat values to an empty map using a random walk algorithm. Both functions return a list with randomized rasters and the observed one. For more information on the methods, please click [here](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/shar/articles/articles/background.html).

```{r habitat_random, eval = FALSE}
torus_trans <- translate_raster(raster = landscape_classified)

random_walk <- randomize_raster(raster = landscape_classified, n_random = 99)
```

```{r plot_habitat-random, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center"}
col = c("#440154FF", "#3B528BFF", "#21908CFF", "#5DC863FF", "#FDE725FF")

plot(torus_trans, n = 3, col = col)
```

To randomize the point pattern, either use the Gamma test described by Plotkin et al. (2000) or pattern reconstruction (Kirkpatrick et al. 1983; Tscheschel & Stoyan 2006). 

```{r pattern-random, eval = FALSE}
gamma_test <- fit_point_process(pattern = species_b, process = "cluster", n_random = 99)

# (this can takes some time)
reconstruction <- reconstruct_pattern(pattern = species_b, n_random = 99, e_threshold = 0.05)
```

Of course, there are several utility functions. For example, you can plot a randomized pattern or calculate the differences between the observed pattern and the randomized patterns (using summary functions). 

```{r plot-random_pattern, fig.width = 5.5, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center"}
plot(reconstruction, verbose = FALSE, ask = FALSE)
```

```{r calculate-energy}
calculate_energy(reconstruction, verbose = FALSE)
```

The data was created that `species_a` has a negative association to habitat 4 and `species_b` has a positive association to habitat 5, which is reflected in the results. 

Given the characteristics of the method, a positive association to one habitat inevitably leads to a negative association to at least one of the other habitats (and vice versa; Yamada et al. 2006). For example, a high amount of individual points in the positively associated habitat simultaneously mean that less individual points can be present in the other habitats.

Furthermore, please be aware that due to the randomization of the null model data, results might slightly differ between different randomization approaches (e.g., `fit_point_process()` vs. `translate_raster()`) and even for repetitions of the same approach. Thus, the exact `lo` and `hi` thresholds might be slightly different when re-running the examples.

However, the counts of the observed data should be identical, and general results and trends should be similar.

```{r results}
significance_level <- 0.01

results_habitat_association(pattern = species_a, raster = torus_trans, significance_level = significance_level)

results_habitat_association(pattern = reconstruction, raster = landscape_classified, significance_level = significance_level)
```
