# CONTRIBUTING #

### Please contribute!

We love collaboration. This includes the suggestion of general improvements to the package structure or functionality, bug reports, typos, or code contributions. We appreciate and welcome **everything** helping to improve the package!

### Bugs?

* Submit an issue on the Issues page [here](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar/issues). Please try to describe the bug as precise and possible and add a reproducible example. This helps us a lot to quickly fix it.

### Code contributions

Generally, we suggest to first open an [issue](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar/issues) to shortly discuss new functionality.

* Fork this repo to your Github account
* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar.git`
* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `shar` at `r-spatialecology/shar`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by e.g. `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step
* Make your changes. We suggest creating a new branch for this
* If you alter package functionality at all (e.g., the code itself, not just documentation), it would be great to write some tests to cover the new functionality
* Push up everything to your account
* Submit a pull request to home base at `r-spatialecology/shar`

### Questions? 
Just drop an [e-mail](mailto:maximilian.hesselbarth@uni-goettingen.de) or open an [issue](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/shar/issues).
