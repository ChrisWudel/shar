# Statement of need

Species-habitat associations are a result of certain species being specialized to certain environmental (also referred to as abiotic) conditions [@Tilman1993] and typically result in a clustering of these species at suitable habitats [@Harms2001; @Comita2007].
Thus, analyzing species-habitat associations can help to understand the influence and importance of abiotic processes shaping the spatial species distribution [@Garzon-Lopez2014].
